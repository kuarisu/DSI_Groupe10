# DSI_Groupe10

RULES (so we don't have any issue when merging): 
- The master branch is ONLY for the lastest working version of the game.
- When merging, we push on the sub master branch and when it's working, on master.
- One scene per personne.
- Be sure that you're the only one working on an element.
- Commit every 20min - 60min.
- One fonctionnality = one branch. 

(- Be careful with the modifications you make on a prefab)
